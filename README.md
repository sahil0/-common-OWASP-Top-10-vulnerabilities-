# -common-OWASP-Top-10-vulnerabilities-




Let us discuss some basic recommendation points for common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and some others (assuming that for almost all major vulnerabilities, OWASP has Wiki documents that can be used for Referencing):

# Injections (SQL): 
SQL injections exist when an application doesn't sanitise user input before passing it into an SQL command. Here are a few recommendations:

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection

Sanitise user input and remove or encode special characters like ‘ “ - () # etc.
Use whitelist filters, which means if a parameter is supposed to have integer values, do not allow non-numeric input. If it is an email field, allow alphanumerics, @ and . (dot)
Use strong web application firewalls to make exploitation difficult
Never run SQL server software (MySQL, MsSQL, etc.) as high privilege user such as ‘root’
Use prepared statements for SQL queries instead of inserting user controlled input into SQL queries
Remove default databases and accounts such as test, guest, admin etc.
# Cross Site Scripting:
This happens when a user controlled input is reflected somewhere else in an HTML page and is not encoded/sanitised properly. This leads to an attacker being able to inject HTML code in the affected page. So, the fix is to make sure that any input which is taken from a user, while being written into an HTTP response must be cleaned first. So, the recommendations can be written as:

Perform proper output encoding of special characters like < > “ ‘
For example, before printing untrusted user-supplied data into an HTML response, convert special characters into HTML encoding (< > " etc.) or URL encode them (%3C %3E %22 %27)
# Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) + Rate Limiting (Brute forcing) flaws:
This happens, when an application doesn't check if a user who is requesting a resource actually is requesting data that he is supposed to view/edit. So, the recommendations can be:

Sensitive information must only be accessible to authorised users
Implement proper authentication and authorisation checks at every function to make sure the user requesting access to a resource whether to view or edit is his own data and no one else's
Implement proper Rate Limiting checks that disallows large number of requests from/to a single resource. For example, if from a single device, a single module like OTP check, password check, signup, etc. is being called 100 times in a single minute, it should be blocked
Similarly, if an account’s password is being attempted to reset even from different devices, the account should be locked for a while
Implement these checks on the basis of IP addresses and sessions

There can be many variables in the application such as “id”, “pid”, “uid”. Although these values are often seen as HTTP parameters, they can be found in headers and cookies. The attacker can access, edit or delete any of other users’ objects by changing the values. This vulnerability is called IDOR.
The insecure direct object references vulnerability allows an attacker to steal other users’ data of a specific type. Beyond just the data in a database, an attacker can exploit it to access restricted files or directories on the server. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), an insecure direct object references vulnerability is commonplace and easy to exploit.

First, it needs to understand the application flow developed by the software developers. All the modules functions and their sub-modules functions need to be understood when the logged-in user into the web/mobile application. It is also important to remember that this vulnerability is as severe as XSS, CSRF in security testing and as a type of vulnerability that is not easily discovered (automatized testing or manual testing).
IDOR can be prevented in many ways like making sensitive information accessible to authorised users, implementing proper authentication and authorisation checks at every function to make sure the user requesting access to a resource whether to view or edit, is his/her data and no one else's.
# Arbitrary File Uploads:
This happens when applications do not implement proper file type checking and allow uploading of files of different file formats. For example, a PHP file instead of a jpeg profile picture.

Perform proper server-side validations on what kind of a file user is uploading
Use white lists filters instead of black list filters. Example: in case of a resume upload feature, instead of banning PHP and .exe files, only allow .pdf, .doc and .docx files
Rename the files using a code, so that the attacker cannot play around with file names
Use static file hosting servers like CDNs and File Clouds to store files instead of storing them on the application server itself
# Cross Site Request Forgery:
This happens, when an application accepts allows critical actions without any additional tokens like passwords and also allows HTTP requests without checking from where exactly they are coming from. To prevent CSRF, all critical actions must be password protected, CSRF token technology should be used to prevent and all requests must first check and make sure that the request is coming from the website itself and not some third party page. So, recommendations can be:

Ask the user his password (temporary like OTP or permanent like login password) at every critical action like while deleting account, making a transaction, changing the password etc.
Implement the concept of CSRF tokens which attach a unique hidden password to every user in every
. Read the documentation related to the programming language and framework being used by your website
Check the referer before carrying out actions. This means that any action on x.com should check that the HTTP referrer is https://x.com/* and nothing else like https://x.com.hacker.com/*
# Using components with known vulnerabilities:
In this, the attacker finds that the server is using an older version of any software, plugin, theme, OS etc. and then uses publicly disclosed vulnerabilities of that specific version to exploit the server. So, the recommendations are:

Upgrade to the latest version of Affected Software/theme/plugin/OS which means latest version number
If upgrade is not possible for the time being, isolate the server from any other critical data and servers
Security Misconfigurations:
The category of security misconfigurations is rather wide and the recommendations are completely different for each misconfiguration but the concept is the same. For example, if a website is using an Apache Tomcat server and is configured with default credentials like tomcat:tomcat, the recommendations would contain the steps to change the password for apache tomcat and suggest to keep a strong alphanumeric password which is difficult to guess.

# Session and Cookie Flaws:
Again these depend upon the exact flaw but below are some common good practices:

Do not store critical information such as passwords in cookies
Set relevant (based on business requirements) expiration time on sessions and cookies
Disallow concurrent logins (login into the same account from multiple devices/locations)
Make sure all cookies are HTTPs protected
Destroy sessions and cookies properly once a user logs out
Do not allow access to any resource without an authenticated and authorised cookie
Cookies and session tokens should be at least 30-40 character long with alphanumerics, which are in no way related to the actual data they are referencing and should be impossible to guess
# Client Side validation flaws:
These issues basically occur when an application does user input sanitisation only at the client side. Like taking the quantity of product to buy using non-editable text fields and + - buttons but once the request is generated using a proxy, you can pass negative or decimal values in quantity and on the server side no checks are in place. Hence, its patch is simple too.

Implement all critical checks on server side code only
Client-side checks must be treated as decoratives only
All business logic must be implemented and checked on the server code. This includes user input, the flow of applications and even the URL/Modules a user is supposed to access or not
